# EmployeeAttendanceManagementSystem - MERN STACKS

Employee Attendance Management System using MERN Stack (NodeJS, ReactJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB).

1. Create Employee Profile
2. Change attendance based on date
3. Delete attendance

An admin can only start attendance once ever day. There are lot more things that could have been possible to implement, Due to time constraint and learning period the project is made in 3 days.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Run the React Client
npm start

# Run the React client only
cd backend && npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```

You will need to create a keys.js in the backend config folder with

```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'YOUR_OWN_MONGO_URI',
  secretOrKey: 'YOUR_OWN_SECRET'
};
```
